This is the ijse course work for mern stack module

Your  task:

1.⁠ ⁠This is a small-scale E-commerce application scoped to a specific business area (like mobile phones, grocery items, car rental, coffee Shop management...etc).

2.⁠ ⁠Customers can purchase something in any quantity and pay. You may add some dummy payment re-directions for the study purpose. (This part is an additional component of the coursework, worth extra mark)

3.⁠ ⁠Admin users/shop owners can apply CRUD operations to their items

4.⁠ ⁠UI libraries are applicable (Tailwind, Bootstrap..). No need to add everything develop from the basic level.

5.⁠ ⁠You may have to R&D about Axios when connecting the front end to the backend. Most of the other dependencies are already discussed in the classroom.

6.⁠ ⁠Try to add some basic security approaches. If you are possible to add JWT, it is better. but it is not necessary. Try any logic to avoid unauthorized purchasing.
